I've always hated my teeth and after having a bike accident and snapping my front two I was even more self-conscious of them. He's done an amazing job they look better than my natural teeth did. He's very calm and reassuring and kept checking in while he worked to make sure nothing was hurting. I can't believe how good they look. They went from yellow, stained wonky and cracked to white and straight. Best money I've ever spent - they look perfect. Thank you Dr Hussain for making me happy to smile.",

Dr Hussain provided exceptional client care service to include telephone advice and email to suit my work commitments. Dr Hussain provided the upmost professional service at all times whilst making sure I felt at ease at all my appointments.

I've always hated my teeth and after having a bike accident and snapping my front two I was even more self-conscious of them. He's done an amazing job they look better than my natural teeth did. He's very calm and reassuring and kept checking in while he worked to make sure nothing was hurting. I can't believe how good they look. They went from yellow, stained wonky and cracked to white and straight. Best money I've ever spent - they look perfect. Thank you Dr Hussain for making me happy to smile.",

He has patience of a saint and was helpful in answering all my questions and concerns I had regarding Invisalign which also included specific advice in relation the ‘complexity’ of an overbite in my case. Dr Hussain provided exceptional client care service to include telephone advice and email to suit my work commitments. Dr Hussain provided the upmost professional service at all times whilst making sure I felt at ease at all my appointments. I would recommend Dr Hussain to anyone who is thinking about Invisalign as you will not only leave with a beautiful smile at the end but also feel very exceptionally pleased with the outcome.",

I've always hated my teeth and after having a bike accident and snapping my front two I was even more self-conscious of them. He's done an amazing job they look better than my natural teeth did. He's very calm and reassuring and kept checking in while he worked to make sure nothing was hurting. I can't believe how good they look. They went from yellow, stained wonky and cracked to white and straight. Best money I've ever spent - they look perfect. Thank you Dr Hussain for making me happy to smile.",

He has patience of a saint and was helpful in answering all my questions and concerns I had regarding Invisalign which also included specific advice in relation the ‘complexity’ of an overbite in my case. Dr Hussain provided exceptional client care service to include telephone advice and email to suit my work commitments. Dr Hussain provided the upmost professional service at all times whilst making sure I felt at ease at all my appointments. I would recommend Dr Hussain to anyone who is thinking about Invisalign as you will not only leave with a beautiful smile at the end but also feel very exceptionally pleased with the outcome.",
